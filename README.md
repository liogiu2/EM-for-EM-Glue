# EM for EM-Glue
 
This repository is an implementation example of a EM that uses the [EM-Glue](https://github.com/liogiu2/EM-Glue) platform to work. It is a dummy experience manager, in fact, all the decision of the actions that the manager wants to take are taken by the user using a command line tool.
